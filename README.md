## 👋 Hi, I’m Jasper

I’m a passionate and enthusiastic senior software engineer with a strong focus on software quality and customer satisfaction.

I bring experience working in multinational, multidisciplinary teams, contributing to every stage of the software development lifecycle. I’m a reliable team player, always eager to learn, and quick to adapt in dynamic environments.

My love for programming began long before my professional career. Even in elementary school, I was already creating computer games—drawn in by the magic of turning an idea into something real that others could enjoy. That sense of creativity and impact still drives me today.

Outside of work, I’m an active contributor to the open source community and always have a side project on the go.
